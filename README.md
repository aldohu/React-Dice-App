# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Dice Roll App

A simple dice roll app that fetches dice images from an API and displays them with smooth animations when the dice are rolled.

## Features
- Roll two dice by clicking a button.
- Fetch dice images dynamically from an API.
- Button disables while fetching the dice images.
- Dice animations on roll.
- State management for dice values and button.

## Components
### Dice Component
- Renders a dice image based on the current dice state.
- Fetches the dice image from the API.

## Project Plan

Here are the steps followed to complete this project:

- [x] **Create dice component**: A component that handles individual dice display.
- [x] **Pull images for dice from API**: Fetches dice images dynamically from a public API.
- [x] **Make states for button and disable during request**: The button is disabled while images for the dice are being fetched to prevent multiple clicks.
- [x] **Make state for dice one and dice two**: Two separate states manage the dice values.
- [x] **Animate dice on roll**: Add animations to the dice when their values change on button click.
